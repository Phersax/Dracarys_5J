##About the Project
This project aims to develop and implement a five-degree-of-freedom anthropomorphic manipu-
lator, whose kinematic architecture is illustrated in the attached fig. 1. The ultimate goal is to
create a modular robotic arm that is entirely 3D-printable and released as open-source, to promote
system reproducibility and accessibility.
The robot is designed using 3D modeling software. Subsequently, 3D printers are used to obtain
the parts needed for assembly. The motors used enable open-loop control.
In fact, stepper motors have rotors that perform predefined rotations as long as no steps are lost,
while the servo motor has an internal control logic that allows for precise movements.
The hardware required to operate the robot will consist of dedicated drivers and a control board.
The ultimate goal of the project is to enable the end effector to follow specific trajectories with a
trapezoidal joint profile.
